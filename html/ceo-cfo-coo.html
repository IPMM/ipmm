Either way, the time to fix it is not when your business has come to a standstill and heads are about to roll. Our review and audit of your actual deployments or plans for new rollouts can identify and eliminate exposure to single points of failure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Geographic</strong> – by understanding exposure to taxes, natural disasters, and political stability factors we can help you locate that key hub away from danger or, better yet, diversify into multiple locations that won’t be hit by the same tsunami or earthquake.</li>
          <li><strong>Vendor</strong> – by ensuring top-​​notch governance and market-​​based price adjustments, we keep even the most strategic vendors from abusing their power and help you diversify your vendor pool for further backup against financially-​​driven change or a service being phased out</li>
          <li><strong>Network and power</strong> – a review of routing can often reveal that seemingly redundant networks and power grids are actually liable to single points of failure. We go the extra mile in due diligence to ensure true redundancy</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural and technical fit</strong> – sometimes the solution you want is not one your organization is ready for. Whether it’s offshoring your desktop support or moving legacy apps to the cloud, we’ve worked to identify red flags and suggest mitigation strategies /​ alternative approaches to close the gap.</li>
